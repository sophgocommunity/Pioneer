## Introduction

Milk-V Pioneer is a developer board based on Sophgo SG2042 (64 Core [T-head C920](./resources/T-Head_XuanTie_C920_Processor_Datasheet.pdf) RISC-V CPU up to 2GHz). With PC-like interfaces and PC industrial compatibility, Pioneer provides native RISC-V development environment and RISC-V desktop experience. Milk-V Pioneer doesn‚Äôt skimp on hardware (e.g. 64-core CPU @ 2 GHz, 128 GB DDR4 RAM @ 3200 MHz, 1 TB PCIe 3.0 SSD, and more), comes in both mainboard and full PC versions, and is competitively priced with comparable x86 machines.

The Milk-V Pioneer Board has the following advantages over previous RISC-V mainboards:
1. **Powerful Processor Performance**: The Pioneer features the SG2042 processor, which boasts 64 cores with a clock frequency of 2 GHz. Compared to the processors used in previous RISC-V boards, the Milk-V Pioneer offers a higher core count, enabling stronger multi-threaded computing capability and processing performance.
2. **Memory Performance**: The Pioneer supports 4 DIMM slots, expandable up to 128 GB of DDR4 memory with ECC support, operating at a speed of 3200 MT/s. 
3. **Abundant Storage Interfaces**: The Pioneer offers a wide range of storage interface options, including a 64 MB SPI Flash, 2 M.2 slots, a microSD card connector, an eMMC module connector, and 5 SATA 3.0 interfaces. This allows developers to choose and expand storage devices more flexibly to meet various application requirements.
